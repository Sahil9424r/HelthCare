This project is a Health Care Center website that uses a Machine Learning-based Recommender System to predict diseases based on user-provided symptoms. It also provides recommendations for precautions, medications, diets, and workouts for the predicted disease.

The system is built using:

Flask for the web application.

Scikit-learn for the machine learning model.

Pandas for data handling.

Bootstrap for the front-end design.
